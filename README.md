Test 

The main purpose of this project is to develop from scratch a JS game using p5.js library. 

Legend of Wawel is a shooter game created in JS, based on a legend of the Wawel Dragon. The start screen includes a link to a website with the info about the legend. After pressing a “START GAME” button, a player controls a dragon using the mouse's movement and shoots fireballs with the left click. 

There are two other characters in the game:

knights who are the enemies; the player shoots them with the fireballs to get points; if a knight manages to go past the dragon, the player loses the game,
sheep; if the player shoots one, a point is deducted from the score, if the player lets it go past, a point is added to the score.

With time, both the knights and the sheep are produced faster and faster to add increasing difficulty to the game.

After the player loses, game over screen is displayed with the final score and a “TRY AGAIN” button which restarts the game.
